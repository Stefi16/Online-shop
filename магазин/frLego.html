            with this highly collectible LEGO® Ideas 21319 CENTRAL PERK set! This wonderful 
            LEGO recreation of the café TV studio set is packed with authentic details, making 
            it a must-have Friends memorabilia item for fans. The iconic seating area with a couch,
             armchair and 2 chairs for the friends is removable for easy play. And check out the 
             stage where Phoebe performed her songs on guitar (and where Ross once played his 
             keyboard and everyone except Phoebe thought he was terrible). The LEGO toy minifigures
             of Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Joey, Phoebe and CENTRAL PERK’s long-suffering manager 
             Gunther. An ideal Friends-themed gift for your own friends and family who love the 
             TV show.
          </p>
          <p>
            The minifigures each have their own items inspired by the TV series, 
            including Ross’s brick-built keyboard and the following accessory elements: 
            Rachel’s tray and coffee cup, Monica’s muffin, Joey’s pizza box, pizza slice and
             ‘man bag’, Chandler’s laptop, Phoebe’s guitar and Gunther’s broom.

        <p>Enjoyed every minute of building it, lots of memories, a bit too easy thou. Finger crossed we will have Monica’s apartment in the future.</p><br>
          <p>Joey788:</p>
          <p>I bought the LEGO friends Central Perk set for my wife as a Christmas gift since we both are huge fans of the show, which was a win win for me and my son as well since we love legos! This was one of the most interesting builds I’ve ever done, and I really took my time with my wife and son (4 years old) to enjoy all of the detail that was put into this set. The LEGO figures were spot on as well! I love the ability to pop the 3 couch/eating sections out to play with separately. Kudos to the LEGO engineers who can who with this one! I do think that LEGO should go a step further with the friends theme, maybe make Monica’s apartment, or Phoebe’s taxi, or Chandler and Joey’s apartment. Fans of both Friends and LEGO would eat that up! As far as the quality of this set, it is worth way more that $60, considering all of the pieces and types of pieces involved! Buy one while you can! Even if it’s just to increase your piece parts for personal builds! The colors are very unique and would work nicely building other things as well!</p><br>

          <p>This set is by far the best value for the money. Lots of details and printed pieces, minimum stickers, plus all the main characters minifig included. Compare with other Lego set with way less pieces but more expensive, this set is a MUST HAVE!!! I am tempted to buy another one just keep it sealed in box.</p><br>
          <p>PotOfGreed59:</p>
          <p>I have waited a long time for a set like this, I'm gutted it's just the one but hopefully with this set being a hit we'll see others pop up too. It took me roughly 6.5 hours total building time over 2 days. Some parts were a little tricky but nothing too complex. The moveable flooring is great for moving characters about to get the perfect scene. The added cameras make it really look like the film set which makes this so much better. Each minifig has been designed perfectly. I can't wait to find a permanent home for it as it'll look good among my many other sets.</p><br>
