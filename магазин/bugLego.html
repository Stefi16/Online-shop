        <p>With all the excellent reviews already available, I thought I would share this instead. -pivot the shaft away from the key just a bit, insert key in a downward angle, and wha la! Perfect key storage. I’ve never seen this mentioned on the official site, yet it fits seamlessly as if by design. </p><br>
          <p>LegoBuilder999:</p>
          <p>The attention to detail on this set is incredible! From the general body design to the complexities involved in the marriage process. There were challenging times while building the engine, but seeing it come together was very worthwhile and satisfying. I have many Lego sets ranging from the Millenium Falcon to other UCM's, and this is by far at the top of my list for most rewarding builds.</p><br>
          <p>NDTysonFan889f:</p>
          <p>I decided to write a review for this product because I had a disappointment from it. After the great feeling of building the 911 Porsche model. I was sure that in this model I have the same or better feeling. The box and books, many parts complexity and details are much more than the Porsche But the design is not good. It seems that Lego wanted to come out with the model and not waited enough time to fix all. Front of the car parts are very loos, the back as well. Front wheel springs don’t hold the wight of the car. I added 2 or 3 more sets of springs to lift the car. One thing I loved is the build of this set finds the same like the Original car. Not all Is bad, it’s a very good model for car lovers but I think I could have more value for money. This model is for the Presentation only. I think that Lego fan will need to choose one model from the car series to have the full experience. The new Lamborghini Sián FKP 37 will not enter to my collection.</p><br>
          <p>DipperGF233:</p>
          <p>The best Lego technic set, very challenging during construction and the final result its amazing.</p><br>
