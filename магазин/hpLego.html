        <p>If you only can have one set This is the one. Its a Nice size, beautiful castle like exterior and interior and you get cool mini figures. Its the most iconic building of Harry Potter and This set captures the best of it. Love the great hall and the decor.</p><br>
          <p>LegoBuilder999:</p>
          <p>This is a really good playset and lots of options to play and place your included figures. With everything from a tiny dormitory to a moving staircase there is more than just the Dining Hall included in the set and it gives you a lot of play value once built. I have to admit the included basilisk is really fun and we have found ourselves randomly attacking each other with it for no other reason than it is funny. Okay, the build itself is the important bit for me and this was one of the more complicated builds I have taken on. By following the printed instructions it is actually much easier than I thought it would be. The images are clear and with the bricks being pre-sorted in to bags it makes it a joy to build. The fact it is split in to bags also gives you natural break points but I will admit I just built this in one gleeful sitting.</p><br>
          <p>JavaDev88:</p>
          <p>This is truly a terrific set, so well designed but its missing the small turrets on the main tower... I've had a look through Pick-a-Brick and with the extra pieces shown I've fixed this, enjoy!</p><br>
          <p>RedditHacker899:</p>
          <p>One day me and my girlfriend walked inside the LEGO store and saw the staff there put this castle on its backside and put the train with it together, the idea was so amazing so we bought the two sets together. The building process was excellent and with a little imagination. We put them two together and has a XBOX as the base , haha! Before we thought one day we would buy the big Hogwarts Castle, but after finishing these two, with more details, we would definitely recommend this one if you don't have much room or already have other castles such as Disney like us!</p><br>
