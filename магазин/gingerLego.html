        <p>My 7 year old daughter built the majority of this set herself. She needed a little help with the roof, but I was really impressed by her building ability and by the set itself. That being said, there is one major design flaw that we both noticed. The gingerbread woman is unable to use any of the furniture inside and outside of the house due to the unwieldiness of her skirt. We came up with a fix for this and wanted to share. We put the skirt on the gingerbread man. Now the gingerbread woman is able to take a relaxing bath while the gingerbread man rocks the baby to sleep in the crib. She can also take a nice nap while he's feeding the baby. She can sit comfortably by the fire while he makes her a perfect cup of tea, and she can enjoy that tea outdoors at the table while he takes the baby for a walk. Five stars for this set (with this fix)! Our Christmas wish is that there is a woman designer for next year's set! </p><br>

          <p>I brought this for myself as I love gingerbread, First time I've played with lego since in was young. I was pleasantly surprised how easy the instructions were and how cute all the little extra touches made. I left the roof to my boyfriend after reading reviews but he had no issues with it at all. please can you make a mini figure gingerbread baby for next year. I loved making it so much I've now brought myself the diner.</p><br>

          <p>This is the first Creator Expert build I’ve done having watched my husband take on a lot - when I spotted the Gingerbread House in store, I knew I wanted it for our Lego Christmas village but also wanted to try my hand at building. As a novice at this level, I found it quite challenging but the sense of satisfaction I got from completing the build was amazing! I love the little details on this set - the bedding and cushions are tiny bars of chocolate, the bow on the present is a pretzel - and the overall finish is gorgeous. It fits in well with the winter train and winter fire station sets and is a great addition to our village. It has also inspired me to get another set for myself because I loved the process of building it. Thank you Lego!</p><br>
